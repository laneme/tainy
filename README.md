## Bug report for tinymce autoresize plugin

This demo is based on a barebones _CRA (create-react-app)_ starter. No styling, no deps other than tinymce and tinymce-react.

### Steps

-   Clone this repo
-   `git checkout with-cra`
-   `yarn`
-   `yarn start`
-   Visit `localhost:3000`

### Api key

-   Put your API key in .env.local file. Name it `REACT_APP_TINYKEY`
-   Or edit the line in src/index.tsx `apiKey={process.env.REACT_APP_TINYKEY}`

### Other branches

-   **main** - NextJS Demo

If you want, replace the initialValue to anything. Or just paste into the editor.
